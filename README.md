## ❌ Stop Blind AI Coding. ✅ Start Real Learning.

> 🧠 Turning AI from a shortcut into a tutor for India's future developers.

## 🚨 The Hidden Crisis

AI coding tools are helping students write code —  
but silently destroying learning.

Across Indian engineering colleges:

⚠️ Students copy AI code without understanding  
⚠️ Problem-solving skills are declining  
⚠️ Interview performance is dropping  
⚠️ Tier 2/3 students are falling further behind  

**AI generates answers.  
It does not verify learning.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution — CodeGuardian

A VS Code extension that ensures students **understand AI-generated code before using it.**

### 🔁 The Learning Guardrail

```
Detect → Explain → Verify → Execute
```

When AI code is detected:

🔒 Execution is locked  
🗣️ Student explains the code (English/Hindi, text/voice)  
🤖 AI evaluates understanding  
🔓 Code unlocks only if comprehension is proven  

---

## 🔥 Killer Feature — ELI5 Guided Learning Mode

If students fail repeatedly:

# 👉 The AI switches from judge to teacher

ELI5 Mode explains the concept using:

🧸 Simple language  
🌍 Real-world analogies  
🪜 Step-by-step breakdown  
❓ Practice questions  

Code unlocks only after learning.

### 🎯 AI stops being a shortcut — becomes a mentor.
